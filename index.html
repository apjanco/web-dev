<p>User Problem: In quarentine I really needed motivation to get anything done, especially completing exercise and/or going for runs. 
I also struggled to keep coming up with or finding new exercises or routes to keep things interesting. My web app would address these issues.
At the start of the app the user could check off all the types of exercises they can feasibly complete day to day. Then when they are ready to exercise
the user could input the amount of time they have available and the intensity level they want and the web app would randomly select one of the exercise types
the user indicated ability in and recommends a couple of links to either related youtube exercise videos or routes/trails etc. that matched the selected 
exercise type. Ideally, the app would remember what links it recommended to prevent duplicate recommendations.</p>
<p>Users: The group this app would benefit most are people who enjoy exercising but are lacking in motivation for some reason, be it quarentine, 
or any other stressor/commitment.</p>
<p>Comparison: There are plenty of workout apps but many of them require a paid subscription or just have a library of a bunch of exercise routines. 
They don't necesarily make reccomendations as I am suggesting this app would. This act of suggestion takes some of the work away from the user which 
can lead to them losing interest or motivation. Having this "workout for you in one click" setup would help combat any loss of motivation.</p>
